# ocl_issues
Consolidated issues for all OCL repositories.

We use [Projects](https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/Projects) to organize the community's roadmap into tickets, and all tickets are stored in this repo (see the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues/issues) tab).

If you would like to report an issue, please first verify that it does not exist yet by searching from the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues/issues) tab. If you are sure it is a new issue, click [here](https://github.com/OpenConceptLab/ocl_issues/issues/new) to report it. An OCL community member will get back to you as soon as possible and may ask for more details, if needed.

NOTE: The OCL community previously used ZenHub Browser Extension in combination with GitHub tickets, but that is now deprecated.
